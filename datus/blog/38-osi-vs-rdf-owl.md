# OSI vs RDF/OWL: Two Generations of Semantics Compared

**RDF/OWL** is the W3C specification stack behind the Semantic Web — formal ontologies, graph triples, inference, and an open-world model of meaning. **OSI** (now Apache Ossie) is a pragmatic YAML interchange format for metrics, dimensions, and relationships, built for the closed world of enterprise analytics. This article defines both, compares them across seven dimensions, and argues that the two are converging rather than competing.

## TL;DR

- **RDF/OWL is the W3C stack behind the 2000s Semantic Web** — formal ontologies, graph triples, inference, open-world assumption. OSI (Apache Ossie) is a 2020s YAML interchange for metrics and dimensions in the closed world of enterprise analytics.
- The core trade-off is **expressive power and generality (RDF/OWL) versus adoption cost and analytical fit (OSI)**: OWL can describe almost any domain, but demands reasoners, ontology tooling, and modeling expertise; OSI covers exactly what analytics tools exchange — metrics, dimensions, datasets, relationships.
- Enterprise analytics is **closed-world by nature**: a warehouse holds a finite set of tables, and "not stated" effectively means "does not exist." That makes the inference-first, open-world RDF/OWL model a poor default fit, however philosophically richer it is.
- The worlds are **converging**: OSI's working groups include an Ontology group mapping OSI concepts to formal ontology standards, and four reference converters (dbt/MetricFlow, GoodData, Salesforce, Apache Polaris) are already merged — portability, not replacement.
- For AI agents, the practical architecture is **both**: an OSI-compatible semantic model for query grounding, with ontology-style structure layered where reasoning crosses concepts — the direction Datus's Context Engine and Subject Tree already take.

## 1. RDF/OWL and the Semantic Web: a working definition

The phrase "semantic web" is older than most data engineers realize: Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler, and Ora Lassila laid out the vision in a May 2001 <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-semantic-web/" rel="nofollow noopener">Scientific American article</a>, proposing a web in which pages carry machine-readable meaning alongside human-readable content. The standards that implemented that vision — RDF, OWL, SPARQL — remain the reference point for what formal, inference-based semantics look like, even as the vision itself evolved into knowledge graphs rather than a universally adopted web. For our purposes, this stack defines the "expressive" end of the OSI comparison: what happens when semantics are maximally general and formally precise. So it is worth pinning down exactly what RDF/OWL is — and what it is not.

A useful working definition:

> **RDF/OWL is the specification stack behind the Semantic Web vision of the early 2000s** — a family of W3C standards for representing machine-readable meaning. RDF (<a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/" rel="nofollow noopener">Resource Description Framework</a>) models knowledge as subject–predicate–object triples: `Acme_Corp hasRevenue 1.2M`. The result is a graph, not a table. OWL (Web Ontology Language) layers formal semantics on top: classes with subclass hierarchies (`EnterpriseCustomer` is a subclass of `Customer`), properties with cardinality constraints (a `Subscription` must have exactly one `Contract`), and logical axioms that let a reasoner infer facts that were never explicitly asserted. SPARQL is the query language that traverses these graphs. The design assumes an **open world**: anything not stated is unknown, not false, and inference is intended to run across independently published schemas. It is not a database, a metric layer, or a query engine — it is a description language, and its power and its cost are two sides of the same coin. In this sense RDF/OWL is not a data format for analytics — it is a language for describing what the world is, aiming to make the entire web machine-readable.

That definition matters because the open-world assumption is not a corner detail; it is the philosophical engine of the whole stack. If an RDF graph does not state whether `Acme_Corp` is a customer, the correct answer in RDF semantics is "unknown," and a reasoner may still derive it from other axioms. In an analytics context that behavior is often exactly backwards: a warehouse query that cannot prove a fact should return an empty set, not an inference. Two practical consequences follow. First, RDF/OWL is expressive enough to model domains that BI tools cannot — finance, pharma, supply chains — which is why ontology remains the right tool for some problems. Second, that expressiveness carries a real tooling burden: reasoners, URI management, ontology editors, and SPARQL endpoints are a different toolchain than the one most data teams already run. For the related question of how semantic layers and ontologies compare as concepts, see [semantic layer vs ontology](/blog/semantic-layer-vs-ontology); this article compares the OSI specification with the RDF/OWL stack specifically.

## 2. OSI (Apache Ossie): a working definition

OSI — the Open Semantic Interchange — is an Apache 2.0-licensed specification for exchanging semantic metadata: metrics, dimensions, datasets, relationships, and business context, expressed in declarative YAML or JSON. The project emerged from a Snowflake-convened coalition in late 2025, entered the Apache Incubator in June 2026 under the name **Apache Ossie**, and as of August 2026 sits at spec v0.1.1 with a 0.2.0-dev branch in progress and more than 50 participating organizations. The architecture is deliberately hub-and-spoke: rather than building converters between every pair of tools, each platform translates to and from OSI as a central, vendor-neutral format. The <a href="https://open-semantic-interchange.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">OSI project site</a> describes the goal in one line — stop redefining "Revenue" in every dashboard, so every tool and agent works from the same source of truth.

A concrete OSI model looks like what a metric layer already produces today:

```yaml
semantic_models:
  - name: fact_orders
    description: Completed customer orders
    datasets: [orders]
    dimensions:
      - name: region
        type: categorical
    measures:
      - name: revenue
        expr: "SUM(revenue_usd - refund_usd)"
        agg: sum
    relationships:
      - from: orders.customer_id
        to: customers.id
```

Three properties separate OSI from the RDF/OWL world. First, OSI is scoped to analytics artifacts — metrics, dimensions, datasets, relationships — and explicitly not a language for describing arbitrary domains. Second, its semantics are closed-world and executable: the model is the complete truth, and no reasoner sits between a definition and the SQL it generates. Third, it is an interchange format, not a query engine — the <a href="https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI" rel="nofollow noopener">specification repository</a> ships converters rather than runtimes. For a full walkthrough of what OSI standardizes and who backs it, see [Open Semantic Interchange (OSI)](/blog/open-semantic-interchange-osi).

## 3. Side-by-side comparison

If you are deciding which of the two to build on, the differences that matter are structural, not cosmetic. The table below compares RDF/OWL and OSI across seven dimensions.

| Dimension | RDF/OWL (Semantic Web) | OSI / Apache Ossie |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Era and origin** | 2000s W3C standards, born from the 2001 Semantic Web vision | 2020s industry spec, Apache Incubator since June 2026 |
| **Formalism** | Formal logic: classes, properties, axioms, inference rules | Declarative YAML/JSON: metrics, dimensions, datasets, relationships |
| **World assumption** | Open world — unstated facts are unknown, not false | Closed world — the model is the complete truth |
| **Inference** | First-class: reasoners derive new facts from axioms | Out of scope: definitions are explicit and executed directly |
| **Query surface** | SPARQL over a graph | None of its own; tools and agents translate models into SQL |
| **Adoption cost** | High: reasoners, ontology tooling, URI management, expertise | Low: YAML files any data engineer can read, edit, and validate |
| **Fit for analytics** | Poor default: built for web-scale knowledge, not warehouse queries | Native: mirrors how BI tools and metric layers already model data |

The pattern across the table is a trade-off, not a scorecard. RDF/OWL wins on generality — its formalism can represent pharmaceutical ontologies, supply-chain graphs, or legal knowledge, none of which reduce to a star schema. OSI wins on adoption cost and analytical fit, because it models exactly the artifacts a warehouse already contains, with semantics that execute. In practice, the row that decides most enterprise conversations is "world assumption": teams evaluating OSI vs RDF vs OWL for analytics rarely need inference, but they always need definitions that translate unambiguously into SQL. For narrower comparisons against specific authoring tools, see [OSI vs dbt/MetricFlow](/blog/osi-vs-dbt-metricflow), [OSI vs LookML](/blog/osi-vs-lookml), and [OSI vs Cube](/blog/osi-vs-cube).

## 4. Why the Semantic Web never fully landed in enterprise analytics — and why OSI's scoping works

The question that follows from the table is why the more expressive technology lost the enterprise analytics market. The Semantic Web did not fail for lack of ambition — the 2001 vision was enormous — but for the economics of adoption. Formal ontologies require reasoners, SPARQL endpoints, URI governance, and a modeling discipline that treats every concept definition as a lasting contract; few analytics teams have any of that tooling. The modeling overhead is the deeper issue: OWL's open-world semantics assume a web of independently published schemas, while a warehouse is a bounded, curated system in which "the model contains everything you may query" is the actual invariant. When the definitions you need describe exactly the tables you have, an inference layer multiplies cost without adding correctness.

What survived from the Semantic Web is telling. Knowledge graphs productized the graph-and-ontology idea into search infrastructure, and RDF/OWL remains the standard in domains that genuinely need it — life sciences, government data, research publishing. What did not survive was the claim that every organization should formally model its world. OSI approaches the same problem from the opposite direction: instead of generalizing semantics until they cover everything, it scopes them to the artifacts analytics actually exchanges, and keeps the model explicit, versioned, and directly executable. That scoping is why OSI has merged four reference converters — dbt/MetricFlow, GoodData, Salesforce, and Apache Polaris — and also why no product yet ships native OSI support: the ecosystem is standardizing the interchange first and the tooling second. For teams still sorting out the semantic-web-versus-semantic-layer question, [what is a semantic layer](/blog/what-is-semantic-layer) covers the closer sibling, and [OSI vs warehouse-native semantics](/blog/osi-vs-warehouse-native-semantics) examines how the standard relates to built-in features in Snowflake and BigQuery.

## 5. The ontology-representation working group: where the two worlds converge

The most interesting development in the OSI effort is not a rivalry with RDF/OWL but the working-group structure itself. As of August 2026, OSI runs five working groups, including Metric Language and Catalog — and an **Ontology** group whose charter is mapping OSI concepts to formal ontology standards. That group is the architectural bridge between the two generations of semantics. Rather than treating RDF/OWL as a competitor, OSI treats it as an upstream language that can be transpiled into OSI and back, with mappings and bindings preserved.

RelationalAI, a founding member of the coalition, describes the rationale in <a href="https://www.relational.ai/post/bringing-ontological-semantics-to-open-semantic-interchange-osi" rel="nofollow noopener">a post on bringing ontological semantics to OSI</a> in practical terms: an enterprise that has invested years in a knowledge graph, an OWL ontology, or an RDF store should not have to choose between that investment and OSI. The ontology group exists so the same definitions can move across ecosystems. The mechanism is the one OSI already uses everywhere — translation. An RDF/OWL model is transpiled into OSI concepts and relationships, moved through the hub to a BI tool or an agent, and transpiled back out if needed. The ontology stays authoritative, and OSI becomes the interchange layer beneath it — a genuinely different posture from the 2000s, when each new standard was expected to replace what came before.

This convergence answers a practical question for teams holding both perspectives: you do not have to bet on one generation of semantics. Keep the ontology where it earns its keep — disambiguation, domain structure, reasoning across concepts — and let an OSI-compatible semantic model carry execution and portability. The bridge exists precisely because the two layers solve different problems. Making interoperability with the RDF/OWL world a working-group charter rather than an afterthought is the strongest signal yet that these are complements, not substitutes.

## 6. What this means for AI agents

AI agents are the reason this comparison matters in 2026. A [text-to-SQL](/blog/what-is-text-to-sql) agent or data copilot needs two capabilities that these two standards provide in very different ways: grounding and reasoning. Grounding means the agent can translate a business question into correct SQL against governed definitions — which is exactly what an OSI-compatible semantic model delivers, because it is closed-world, explicit, and directly executable. Reasoning means the agent can navigate relationships between concepts and disambiguate terms — which is what ontology-style structure delivers, and what RDF/OWL was designed for.

The synthesis is the layered architecture [data engineering agents](/blog/what-is-data-engineering-agent) are converging on. A [semantic model](/blog/what-is-semantic-model) in OSI form gives the agent the metrics, dimensions, joins, and business context it needs to generate a trustworthy query. An ontology-like layer above it gives the agent domain awareness — what belongs in the marketing domain, whether "product" means a physical SKU or a service tier, which relationship is the right one for a given question. The split matters because the two layers fail in different ways: a missing semantic model produces wrong SQL, while a missing ontology layer produces plausible SQL with confused concepts. Teams that build agents without either layer get confident wrong answers; teams that build both get agents that can query and reason.

This is the architecture Datus builds its Context Engine around, for teams that want the both-layer outcome without owning an OWL toolchain. The engine consumes OSI-compatible semantic models and metrics — via commands like `/gen_semantic_model` and `/gen_metrics` — for the executable layer, while the Subject Tree organizes business domains into a lightweight, ontology-like hierarchy that scopes Subagents and resolves ambiguity. The posture is deliberately pragmatic: enough domain structure for agents to navigate, without the full cost of formal ontology engineering. Teams that already maintain a serious knowledge graph lose nothing by adopting OSI, because the ontology working group's mapping keeps that investment interoperable.

## 7. Common misconceptions

A few misconceptions recur in almost every OSI-versus-RDF/OWL conversation, and they tend to push teams toward the wrong default. The pattern is worth naming because it repeats regardless of audience — data engineers, analytics engineers, and platform teams all ask the same four questions.

**"OSI is a replacement for RDF/OWL."** It is an interchange format, not a language. RDF/OWL models can be transpiled into OSI and back, and the Ontology working group exists precisely to preserve formal semantics in transit. Framing OSI as a rival to OWL mistakes the hub for a competitor.

**"The Semantic Web failed."** The universal web layer never materialized, but the ideas productized successfully — knowledge graphs became foundational to search, and OWL still anchors domains that need genuine reasoning, from life sciences to government data. What failed was adoption economics for the average enterprise, which is exactly the cost problem OSI's scoping targets.

**"A closed-world model is objectively worse than an open-world one."** Open world is the right contract when knowledge is incomplete and distributed across independent publishers. Closed world is the right contract when a curated warehouse defines the complete universe of queries — which is what enterprise analytics is, by construction. Neither contract is universally superior.

**"OSI needs inference to compete with OWL."** If OSI shipped a reasoner, it would stop being a lightweight interchange format and become an ontology platform, with a different adoption curve and a different set of users. The two standards do not need to converge on features; they need to interoperate. The ontology-mapping working group is a better bridge than feature parity.

The common thread is category confusion: comparing OSI with RDF/OWL as if they were two languages fighting for the same job. They occupy different layers — one describes the world, the other exchanges definitions about a warehouse. When the comparison is framed correctly, the decision stops being "which one" and becomes "how do they fit in the same stack." That framing is the thread running through the rest of the OSI comparison series, which examines where the standard sits relative to MetricFlow, LookML, Cube, and warehouse-native semantics specifically.

## Conclusion

RDF/OWL and OSI are two generations of the same ambition — making meaning machine-readable — separated by thirty years of lessons about adoption. The Semantic Web optimized for expressive power and paid for it in tooling burden and modeling overhead; OSI optimizes for adoption cost and analytical fit, and is explicit about the scope it gives up in return. Neither is a mistake, and neither replaces the other: one describes the world, the other moves definitions through a stack.

For most data teams, the practical answer is not a bet on one standard but a division of labor: a closed-world, OSI-compatible semantic model for execution and portability, with ontology-style structure layered where agents need to reason across concepts. The OSI community appears to have drawn the same conclusion — its Ontology working group is the bridge, not the battleground.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is the difference between OSI and RDF/OWL?

OSI (Open Semantic Interchange, now Apache Ossie) is a YAML/JSON interchange format for the semantic metadata an analytics stack actually exchanges — metrics, dimensions, datasets, and relationships — with closed-world, executable semantics. RDF/OWL is the W3C stack behind the Semantic Web vision: a formal language for describing domains with classes, properties, and inference rules under an open-world assumption, queried via SPARQL. In short, RDF/OWL describes what the world is; OSI exchanges definitions about a warehouse. The trade-off is expressive power and generality versus adoption cost and analytical fit.

### Is OSI a replacement for the Semantic Web or OWL?

No. OSI is an interchange format, not a language, reasoner, or query engine. RDF/OWL models can be transpiled into OSI and back with mappings preserved, and OSI's Ontology working group exists specifically to map OSI concepts to formal ontology standards. Think of OSI as the hub that lets tools understand one another, and RDF/OWL as one of the languages that can speak through it.

### What is the open-world assumption, and why does it matter for analytics?

The open-world assumption says that anything not stated in a knowledge base is unknown, not false — so a reasoner may derive conclusions from what is absent. It is the right model when knowledge is incomplete and distributed, as on the web. Enterprise analytics is effectively closed-world: a warehouse contains a finite set of tables, and "not stated" means "does not exist here." That mismatch is the main reason the RDF/OWL model is a poor default fit for analytics, even though it is philosophically richer.

### Can OSI and RDF/OWL be used together?

Yes — that is the direction the ecosystem is heading. OSI's Ontology working group maps OSI concepts to formal ontology standards so that an OWL ontology or RDF store can be transpiled into OSI, moved across tools, and transpiled back with its bindings intact. A team can keep its knowledge graph authoritative for disambiguation and domain structure while an OSI-compatible semantic model handles execution and portability for agents and BI tools.
