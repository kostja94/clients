# OSI vs Cube: Headless Semantic Layer Meets Open Standard

Cube sits in the OSI working group and still has no merged converter. That single fact is the article: a product that joins a working group and a product that supports a standard are not the same commitment. OSI is the open interchange format that makes definitions portable; Cube is the headless semantic layer that makes them executable. Reading that adoption status precisely is how you know what to rely on today and what to merely track.

## TL;DR

- **OSI vs Cube** is a comparison between an open standard and a semantic layer product: OSI (Open Semantic Interchange, now Apache Ossie) defines a portable YAML/JSON format for semantic metadata, while Cube is an API-first headless semantic layer that defines, executes, and serves semantics — one moves definitions between tools, the other runs them.
- OSI is a specification (Apache 2.0) backed by a 50+ organization working group, with four merged reference converters (dbt/MetricFlow, GoodData, Salesforce, Apache Polaris).
- Cube is an open-source product (Apache 2.0 core, ~20K GitHub stars) with cube data models in YAML or JavaScript, CubeStore pre-aggregation caching, and SQL, REST, GraphQL, MCP, and AI APIs.
- Cube participates in the OSI working group, but as of August 2026 no Cube-to-OSI converter is merged — OSI support from Cube is a roadmap signal, not a shipped feature.
- The two are complementary layers: author semantics in Cube, interchange them via OSI, and consume them in any OSI-compatible tool — an architecture that matters even more for AI agents.

## 1. One standard, one product

Most of the confusion in this space comes from mistaking a specification for a product. Before comparing features, it helps to pin down what each of these actually is — and what it is not. A useful working definition:

> **OSI vs Cube** is not a battle between two semantic layer tools but a comparison between an open interchange standard and a headless semantic layer product operating at different layers. OSI — the Open Semantic Interchange specification, now Apache Ossie — is an Apache-2.0 standard that defines how semantic metadata (metrics, dimensions, datasets, relationships) is represented in YAML or JSON, so definitions authored in one tool can be consumed in another without re-authoring. It stores nothing, executes nothing, and serves no API. Cube is an open-source, API-first headless semantic layer product: teams define business semantics in cube data models (YAML or JavaScript), Cube resolves those definitions into optimized SQL, caches hot queries in CubeStore pre-aggregations for sub-50ms response times, and serves results through SQL, REST, GraphQL, MCP, and a dedicated AI API. OSI moves definitions between tools; Cube runs them. The two are complementary layers — a team can define semantics in Cube, export them in OSI format, and consume the same definitions in any other OSI-compatible tool. As of mid-2026, Cube is a working-group member, but no Cube-to-OSI converter has been merged into the Apache Ossie repository: OSI compatibility from Cube is intent without shipped support.

That definition draws a boundary most vendor materials blur on purpose. OSI is a contract about representation; Cube is a runtime that happens to author its data models in YAML and JavaScript files. Neither replaces the other: OSI is useless without a runtime to execute the definitions it carries, and Cube — like any authoring tool — needs an interchange path if its definitions are to travel beyond its own API surface.

**What OSI is: an open interchange standard, not a runtime.** OSI, the Open Semantic Interchange specification now being shepherded through the [Apache Incubator as Apache Ossie](/blog/open-semantic-interchange-osi), is a vendor-neutral format for semantic metadata. The specification at <a href="https://github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI" rel="nofollow noopener">github.com/open-semantic-interchange/OSI</a> defines how metrics, dimensions, datasets, relationships, and business context are represented in YAML or JSON — and, critically, it separates definition from implementation. An OSI metric says what the metric is and how it relates to other entities; it does not say where the query runs or which SQL dialect to use.

That separation is what makes the standard portable. A `net_revenue` metric defined once in OSI format can be translated into Snowflake SQL, BigQuery SQL, or a Cube API query, depending on which engine consumes it. As of August 2026 the specification is at v0.1.1 (with 0.2.0-dev work in progress), the working group spans more than 50 organizations — from Snowflake, Databricks, and Google to dbt Labs, Cube, AtScale, and a long tail of BI, catalog, and enterprise vendors — and the project holds four merged reference converters (dbt/MetricFlow, GoodData, Salesforce, Apache Polaris) that translate between vendor formats and OSI. The standard is real and it is moving fast; what does not yet exist is a single product with user-facing OSI import or export.

**What Cube is: a headless semantic layer product.** Cube is the opposite kind of artifact: a product you install, configure, and query. As detailed in our [Cube.dev agentic analytics analysis](/blog/cube-agentic-analytics), Cube evolved from an open-source dashboard framework into an API-first headless semantic layer. Teams define measures, dimensions, joins, segments, and pre-aggregations in cube data models — written in YAML or JavaScript — and those definitions are what every downstream consumer sees: not raw tables, but governed business objects.

The distinguishing trait is execution. Cube resolves a data model into optimized SQL, runs it against any of its 25+ connectors, caches hot queries in CubeStore pre-aggregations for sub-50ms response times, and serves the results through a broad API surface — CubeSQL (Postgres-compatible), REST, GraphQL, MCP, and a dedicated AI API. The open-source core is Apache-2.0 licensed with roughly 20K GitHub stars, and the D3 platform (June 2025) added AI Data Analyst and AI Data Engineer agents that operate on top of the semantic layer, as described in the <a href="https://cube.dev/docs" rel="nofollow noopener">Cube documentation</a>. Where OSI standardizes how definitions are written down, Cube standardizes how they are turned into answers.

## 2. Key differences: product vs standard

The table below answers a single question: what does each technology actually deliver, and where does each sit in a query path? The rows track type, primary job, format, execution, governance, AI agent access, and OSI status as of August 2026.

| Dimension | OSI (Apache Ossie) | Cube |
|---|---|---|
| **Type** | Open interchange standard (Apache 2.0 spec) | Product — open-source core + commercial cloud |
| **Primary job** | Define a portable format for semantic metadata | Define, execute, and serve semantic definitions |
| **Format** | OSI YAML/JSON (spec v0.1.1 / 0.2.0-dev) | Cube data models (YAML or JavaScript) |
| **Execution** | None — no query engine, no cache | Yes — resolves models to SQL; CubeStore pre-aggregations (sub-50ms) |
| **Governance** | Standards body + 50+ org working group | Vendor governance; access control enforced at query time |
| **AI agent access** | Machine-readable definitions for agent context | SQL, REST, GraphQL, MCP, and dedicated AI API endpoints |
| **OSI status (Aug 2026)** | — | Working-group member; no merged converter |

Read the execution row first, because it is where the two diverge most. OSI has no runtime by design — it cannot answer a query, apply a filter, or enforce row-level security; it only describes semantics in a standard shape. Cube does all of those things, but only for definitions it understands natively. That division of labor is the entire relationship: OSI is the interchange contract between tools, and Cube is one of the tools that can honor it. The format row is also worth a second look, because both sides use YAML — a coincidence that generates more confusion than any other detail.

## 3. Adoption status: working-group member, not a merged converter

Cube has been in the OSI conversation from the beginning, listed among the semantic-layer vendors in the working group alongside dbt Labs, AtScale, and Denodo. That matters: participation by the leading open-source headless semantic layer signals that the industry is serious about interoperability. But participation is not support, and the honest as-of-August-2026 status is that Cube has no merged converter in the <a href="https://github.com/apache/ossie" rel="nofollow noopener">Apache Ossie repository</a>.

Four reference converters are merged there — dbt/MetricFlow, GoodData, Salesforce, and Apache Polaris — and none of them is Cube. A reference converter is a working CLI mapping that proves the format translation is technically understood; it is not a product feature, but it is the difference between "we intend to support OSI" and "the mapping exists in the standard's repository." For a full vendor-by-vendor picture, see the [semantic layer tools list with OSI status](/blog/semantic-layer-tools-list-osi).

The fair reading for Cube is nuanced. Its breadth of API surface, its caching, and its agentic analytics layer are real strengths today; OSI compatibility is a roadmap signal. Teams evaluating Cube for portability should ask for a concrete timeline — and treat any answer that stops at "we are in the working group" as an intent statement rather than a commitment.

## 4. The layer relationship: define, export, consume

The cleanest way to think about OSI and Cube is as three steps in one pipeline. First, you define semantics — in Cube, for teams that choose it, which is why Cube's modeling experience matters. Second, you export those definitions in OSI format, so they are no longer locked to Cube's API surface. Third, any OSI-compatible consumer — a BI tool, a catalog, an AI agent, another semantic layer — reads the same definitions and turns them into whatever it runs natively.

A concrete sketch: a team maintains `net_revenue` as a Cube measure with a defined filter on `order_status = 'completed'`. Through an OSI path, that same definition is exported as a portable OSI document carrying the metric formula, its grain, and its business context, and a downstream tool imports it without the team re-authoring the logic. This is the pattern the [semantic layer](/blog/what-is-semantic-layer) movement has been circling for a decade: one governed semantic model, many consumption surfaces. What makes it real today is not the standard itself — it is that the first two steps already exist for some tools in the ecosystem.

## 5. When to use Cube vs when to use OSI

Choosing between them is a category error, because they do not compete — but there are still clear answers about what to adopt first, depending on where a team is.

- Choose **Cube** when you need governed metrics served to many consumers today: embedded analytics, multi-tool distribution, sub-50ms caching, and an API surface that AI agents can query directly. If the bottleneck is "we have definitions but no way to serve them," that is a Cube-shaped problem.
- Adopt **OSI thinking** when definitions must travel — across multiple warehouses, multiple BI tools, or a new AI stack next quarter — or when you want to stop re-authoring the same metric in five places. If the bottleneck is "we re-author `net_revenue` in every tool," that is an OSI-shaped problem.
- Do **not** wait for the standard to start governing metrics. Teams that "wait for OSI" end up with nothing to standardize; teams that define their twenty most important KPIs in Cube, MetricFlow, or any decent authoring tool today will have something to export when native support lands.

The same product-vs-standard lens applies to the rest of the OSI comparison series: authoring tool versus interchange standard, not two products fighting for the same slot.

## 6. Why context-versus-execution decides agent accuracy

For AI agents, the product-vs-standard distinction is not academic; it determines whether the agent has context or an execution path. The production numbers make the stakes concrete: on the Spider 2.0 benchmark, which measures SQL agents against real enterprise workflows, GPT-4o scored about 10.1% and o1-preview about 17.1% in production settings — versus roughly 86% on academic tasks per the <a href="https://spider2-sql.github.io" rel="nofollow noopener">Spider 2.0 leaderboard</a>. The gap is not model capability; it is context. Agents that cannot resolve what a column or metric means, in a governed form, default to guessing.

OSI and Cube attack opposite halves of that problem. OSI gives an agent portable, machine-readable business definitions — the context it can read before writing a single line of SQL, so it knows `amount_usd` means net revenue after refunds rather than gross transaction value. Cube gives the agent a governed surface to query: a semantic API that resolves definitions, enforces access control, and applies caching, so the model never touches raw tables. In practice both are needed — OSI is what you feed the agent, and Cube is where the agent sends the query. The growing support for MCP across the ecosystem is an early sign of this converging: tools standardizing how agents connect to semantics, with OSI standardizing the shape of what they read.

The complementary piece is who keeps those definitions current. Standards describe a format, not a maintenance cycle. The durable architecture is define, export, consume — with a process that keeps the definitions accurate between exports.

## Conclusion

OSI and Cube are not competitors; they are two layers of the same stack. OSI is the open interchange standard that makes semantic definitions portable — an Apache-2.0 spec backed by more than 50 organizations, with four merged reference converters and zero product-grade exports as of August 2026. Cube is the headless semantic layer product that makes those definitions executable — a broad API surface, sub-50ms caching, agentic analytics, and a working-group seat that has not yet produced a converter. The honest takeaway for teams is twofold: Cube's strengths are real and deployable today, and OSI compatibility from Cube is a roadmap signal to track rather than a feature to rely on. Whichever authoring tool you pick, build semantics as if they will travel — define them in one place, keep them governed, and export them when the interchange path arrives. Teams that wait for the standard will have nothing to standardize; teams that define their KPIs today will have something to export.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is OSI a semantic layer like Cube?

No. OSI (Open Semantic Interchange, now Apache Ossie) is a specification that defines a portable YAML/JSON format for semantic metadata — metrics, dimensions, datasets, and relationships. It does not store, execute, or serve definitions. Cube is a semantic layer product that does all three: it defines semantics in cube data models, executes queries, caches them, and serves them through SQL, REST, GraphQL, MCP, and AI APIs. OSI is the format; Cube is one of the runtimes that honor it.

### Does Cube support OSI?

As of August 2026, Cube is a member of the OSI working group but has not shipped OSI support. No Cube-to-OSI converter is merged in the Apache Ossie repository, and no semantic layer product ships user-facing OSI import or export yet. Cube's participation signals intent; the absence of a converter means the mapping from cube data models to OSI has not been demonstrated in the standard's repository — unlike dbt/MetricFlow, GoodData, Salesforce, and Apache Polaris.

### Are Cube data model YAML and OSI YAML the same thing?

The syntax family is shared, but the contract differs: cube data model YAML is tool configuration executed by Cube; OSI YAML is an interchange document that any conforming tool can consume. Same file extension, different promise.

### Does adopting OSI mean replacing Cube?

The opposite. OSI needs a runtime to be useful, and Cube needs an interchange path for its definitions to travel. The standard extends Cube's reach; it does not remove it.

### Can I export a Cube data model in OSI format today?

Not through a supported feature. As of August 2026 there is no native Cube OSI export and no merged Cube-to-OSI reference converter, so exporting cube data model definitions to OSI format requires building the mapping yourself or waiting for Cube to ship one. The practical advice is to keep definitions portable in spirit — clean naming, governed filters, documented business context — so the export is trivial when a converter arrives.

### Should I adopt Cube, OSI, or both?

Both, in sequence. Choose Cube (or another authoring tool) when you need governed semantics served to many consumers today; adopt OSI thinking — portable, tool-neutral definitions — as the architectural target. Do not wait for the standard to start governing metrics: define your KPIs now, keep them maintained, and treat OSI as the interchange path that will let them travel later.
