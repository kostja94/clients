# How a Context Engine Makes Data Engineering Agents More Accurate

The accuracy gap between data engineering agents comes down to one thing: not which LLM they use, but what context they provide before asking the model to generate a query.

## TL;DR

- A context engine has three jobs: **inspect** (discover schemas and patterns from real data), **retrieve** (find the right context at query time), and **update** (incorporate feedback into the context store).
- The retrieval quality—not the LLM quality—is the ceiling on agent accuracy. A brilliant model with poor context retrieval will generate confidently wrong SQL.
- What makes a context engine effective: dual-dimension organization (physical catalog + logical subject tree), feedback-driven updates, and reference SQL that grounds queries in proven patterns rather than generating from scratch.
- In one production deployment (Yunqi Lakehouse), self-service analytics rates rose from 15% to 60%—not because the model improved, but because the context it operated on accumulated.

## 1. The accuracy bottleneck is not the LLM

A useful mental model: think of a [data engineering agent](/blog/what-is-data-engineering-agent) as having two brains. The fast brain is the LLM—it generates SQL, plans multi-step tasks, and composes natural-language responses. The slow brain is the context engine—it builds and maintains the knowledge about your data that the fast brain queries before generating anything.

Most discussion of agent accuracy focuses on the fast brain: which model, which prompt, which few-shot examples. This is a category error. The fast brain can only be as accurate as the context it receives. Give GPT-5.2 a brilliant prompt but incorrect information about which columns are deprecated, which join paths produce duplicates, and which metric definition the finance team uses—and it will produce brilliant, confidently wrong SQL.

The accuracy ceiling is set by the context engine, not the LLM. This is why the agents that will define the category are the ones that invest in context infrastructure, not the ones that invest in prompt engineering.

## 2. The three jobs of a context engine

### Job 1: Inspect — discover what exists

Before the agent can answer questions about your data, it needs to know what data you have. The context engine connects to your warehouse—or reads from your catalog—and builds an inventory: databases, schemas, tables, columns, types, primary keys, foreign keys, and any existing documentation or semantic annotations.

This is the foundation every agent shares. Where they diverge is how deeply they inspect. A shallow inspection captures column names and types. A deep inspection captures:

- **Data patterns:** Which columns are likely measures vs. dimensions based on data type and distribution (numeric, high-cardinality categorical, date fields)
- **Join paths:** Which foreign key relationships exist, which are actually used in queries, and which produce duplicate rows
- **Usage signals:** Which tables and columns are most frequently queried, which have been deprecated, which naming conventions imply relationships

A deep inspection produces better context. Better context produces more accurate queries.

### Job 2: Retrieve — find what matters at query time

When a user asks "show me weekly net revenue by region for Q2," the agent needs to retrieve a specific subset of context:

- Which tables contain revenue data (`fact_orders`, not `fact_sessions`)
- Which column represents net revenue (`amount_usd`, not `revenue_usd`)
- How revenue relates to region (join via `region_id` in `dim_geo`, not `geo_key` in `dim_customer`)
- What "Q2" means in this warehouse's date dimensions (calendar quarter, `order_completed_at` timestamp)
- Whether a test-account filter applies (yes, `account_type != 'test'` in the source, `is_internal = false` in the warehouse)

The retrieval quality determines accuracy. Retrieve too little context, and the agent lacks the information to generate correct SQL. Retrieve too much, and the context overwhelms the LLM's context window—or dilutes the signal with irrelevant information.

Effective retrieval requires both dimensions of organization. The physical catalog tree gives the agent a structured map of databases, schemas, and tables with their semantic annotations. The logical subject tree organizes knowledge by business domain—topics, metrics, and reference SQL grouped by what they mean, not where they live. A query about "revenue" retrieves context from the finance subject node, which pulls in the relevant tables from the catalog tree, the validated metric definitions, and the reference SQL that has proven correct. This dual-dimension retrieval is what separates a context engine from a simple schema dump.

### Job 3: Update — learn from feedback

The most important job—and the one most agents skip entirely.

Every time a user confirms a query (upvote in chat, no issue reported), the context engine strengthens the pattern that produced it. Every time a user corrects a query (issue report, "this should have excluded test accounts"), the context engine updates the relevant rules, and the next query avoids the same mistake.

This feedback loop is the engine of accuracy improvement. Without it, the agent's accuracy is static—it starts at its baseline and stays there, limited by whatever context was loaded at setup. With it, accuracy compounds. The hundredth query is more accurate than the first, not because the LLM changed, but because the context it operates on accumulated six months of corrections, validations, and usage patterns.

An <a href="https://datus.ai/glossary">evaluation framework</a> that tracks exact SQL match, result count, schema usage, and semantic correctness provides the measurement layer—showing whether accuracy is actually improving and which types of queries need more attention.

## 3. What a context engine is not

To be precise about what makes a context engine different from adjacent concepts:

- **It is not a data catalog.** A <a href="https://datus.ai/glossary">data catalog</a> inventories assets for human discovery. A context engine organizes context for machine retrieval at query time. The catalog tells a person where to look. The context engine tells an agent what to use.

- **It is not a semantic layer.** A [semantic layer](/blog/what-is-semantic-layer) defines governed metrics and dimensions. A context engine includes semantic definitions but extends them with validated SQL, deprecation notes, feedback history, and business rules that move faster than governance cycles. The semantic layer is the certified foundation; the context engine is the living layer on top.

- **It is not a vector database.** Some context engines use vector search for retrieval—finding semantically similar queries and schemas. But a context engine is more than its retrieval mechanism. It includes the inspection logic that builds context, the organizational model that structures it, the feedback loop that updates it, and the delivery mechanisms that package it for consumption.

## 4. How a context engine improves accuracy in practice

Here is a concrete example of how context accumulation changes query accuracy over time.

**Week 1.** User asks: "Show me revenue by region." The context engine retrieves the schema for `fact_orders` and `dim_geo`, generates a query joining on `region_id`, and returns results. The user upvotes—correct. The context engine stores this query as validated reference SQL and strengthens the `region_id` join path association.

**Week 2.** User asks: "Show me revenue by customer segment." The context engine retrieves the previous revenue query pattern, finds the `dim_customer` table, identifies `segment` as a dimension, and generates a query that correctly joins `fact_orders → dim_customer` on `customer_id` while preserving the validated region join from Week 1. Faster generation, higher accuracy—because the engine had a proven pattern to adapt rather than starting from scratch.

**Week 3.** A new user asks: "Monthly net revenue for the board deck." The context engine retrieves the validated revenue pattern, but a different user—the finance team—has previously filed an issue report noting that "net revenue uses `amount_usd` minus refunds, with FX rates locked at close date." The engine applies this correction. The query returns finance-grade revenue numbers. The new user does not need to know that the finance team filed that correction three weeks ago. The context engine already knows.

This is the compounding effect: validated SQL provides proven patterns to adapt. Corrections prevent repeated mistakes. Usage signals strengthen the patterns that work. Over time, the engine builds a representation of the warehouse that reflects not just what the schema says, but what the team has learned about the schema.

## 5. Why this matters for evaluating agents

When evaluating a data engineering agent, the accuracy of a single demo query tells you almost nothing. Any modern agent with any modern LLM can nail a well-scoped query against a clean schema. The demos are designed to work.

The questions that predict long-term accuracy are:

- **How does the agent build its initial context?** Does it only read column names, or does it analyze data patterns, identify join paths, and infer metric types?
- **How does the agent retrieve context at query time?** Does it stuff the entire schema into the prompt (works for 10 tables, breaks for 1,000), or does it selectively retrieve the subset of context relevant to the query?
- **Does the agent have a feedback loop?** When a user corrects a wrong answer, does the correction survive the session? Does the next query avoid the same mistake?
- **Does the agent store validated SQL as reference patterns?** Or does it generate every query from scratch, missing the opportunity to adapt proven patterns?

The answers to these questions determine whether the agent's accuracy plateaus at its demo-quality baseline or improves toward production reliability over weeks of real use. A stronger LLM paired with shallow context will still plateau on ambiguous warehouse-specific questions. A modest LLM paired with a deep context engine can outperform it on repeated domain patterns because it has better local facts.

For a practical comparison of how different agents handle these questions, see the [best data engineering agents comparison](/blog/best-data-engineering-agents).

## Conclusion

A context engine is the slow brain of a data engineering agent: the component that inspects your data, retrieves relevant context at query time, and updates that context based on feedback. Its quality—not the LLM's quality—sets the ceiling on agent accuracy.

The agents that will define this category are the ones that invest in context infrastructure: deep schema inspection, dual-dimension context organization, feedback-driven updates, and reference SQL pattern storage. Agents that treat the LLM as the whole product can produce brilliant demos and still plateau. Agents that treat context as the product have a clearer path to improving on repeated production workloads.

This is the practical implication of [contextual data engineering](/blog/contextual-data-engineering): accuracy is not a feature of the model. It is a property of the context. In Datus, the store behind that loop is what we introduce as [Datus Knowledge](/blog/introducing-datus-knowledge).

## Frequently asked questions

### Does a better LLM eliminate the need for a context engine?

No. A better LLM generates more syntactically elegant SQL. It does not know which of three join paths is the authoritative one for your warehouse, which metric definition finance uses, or which columns were deprecated last month. Those are facts about your data, not facts about SQL. A context engine provides those facts. Even the best LLM, without them, will produce confidently wrong answers when the data context is ambiguous. Think of the LLM as the engine and the context engine as the navigation system—a more powerful engine does not help if you are driving in the wrong direction.

### How long does a context engine take to build useful context?

The initial bootstrap—inspecting schemas, inferring metric types, indexing existing SQL—takes minutes to hours depending on warehouse size. The feedback-driven accuracy improvement compounds over weeks: early queries are 60-80% accurate for common patterns, rising to 85-95% after a month of active use with corrections. The key variable is not time—it is volume of feedback. A team that actively uses the agent and corrects wrong answers will see faster improvement than a team that runs occasional queries without providing feedback.

### Can I use my existing dbt project or semantic layer as the context engine?

Partially. A well-maintained dbt project or semantic layer provides excellent schema and metric context (Layer 2 in the three-layer model). What it typically lacks is Layer 3: validated ad-hoc SQL, deprecation notes, usage-based corrections, and a feedback loop that updates context between governance cycles. A context engine can ingest and reinforce existing semantic definitions while adding the institutional memory layer. The two are complementary: the semantic layer is the governed foundation; the context engine is the living layer that captures what the team learns between modeling sprints.
